# DNSProxy
DNS proxy / DNS monitor / Reverse Proxy that enables a developer to view all of the DNS traffic between their machine and the Internet.

It's like charles proxy or proxyman but for dns.

## About

Want to get a list of hosts and ip addresses that some app is accessing so you can add it to the bypass list on the router? Or do you want to edit the dns server response (not implemented yet) and send the application to your server? Then this utility is for you.
